# Project 2: Air Pollution and Sickle Cell Disease

This repository contains my work for Project 2.

Project2_Ruiyang Hu.Rmd`: R Markdown file that generates the final report (Word document).
AQ_2018.csv`, `AQ_2019.csv`, `AQ_2020.csv`: Daily air pollution measurements from 2018–2020.
Project2_Ruiyang Hu.docx`: Knitted Word report.

The goal of this project is to clean raw air pollution data (CO, PM2.5, O3) from RDU, 
compute daily and monthly summaries, and create exploratory plots to explore temporal patterns 
that may relate to sickle cell disease outcomes in Durham County.
